##Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest
This repository contains a project that predicts gold prices using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm. 
The project is implemented in Python and leverages various data science libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

##Introduction
Gold price prediction is a critical task for investors and analysts. 
This project aims to predict future gold prices based on historical data using the Random Forest algorithm. 
The Random Forest algorithm is chosen due to its robustness and effectiveness in handling time series and regression problems.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes historical gold prices and various economic indicators that influence gold prices. The data can be obtained from financial databases like Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.

##Model
The Random Forest algorithm is used to predict gold prices. The model training involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data.
Model Training: Training the Random Forest model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), ), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared

##Results
The performance of the Random Forest model is evaluated on a test dataset. Below are some key metrics obtained from the model evaluation:

##R-squared of model: 0.9882685005799133

Additionally, visualizations such as actual vs. predicted prices and error distributions are provided in the notebook.
